# Overview Introduction

This section contains a comprehensive list of requirements and overview of relevant IoT protocols.
An initial research is done to assure coverage of protocols which we should consider for mapping to the use cases in the next step.
In the end, a first judgement of fit and maturity of the protocols for each usecase can be made based on the data collected during the research.
